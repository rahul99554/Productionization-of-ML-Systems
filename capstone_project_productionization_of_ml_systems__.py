### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The dataset contains 271,888 entries and 10 columns, with no missing values.
*   New features representing the month, day of the week, and day of the year were successfully extracted from the 'date' column.
*   Categorical features such as 'from', 'to', 'flightType', and 'agency' were one-hot encoded, resulting in 29 columns for the model.
*   The data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
*   A `RandomForestRegressor` model was chosen and trained on the training data.
*   The trained model achieved excellent performance metrics on the test set:
    *   Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $\approx 0.000314$
    *   Mean Squared Error (MSE): $\approx 0.000154$
    *   Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $\approx 0.0124$
    *   R-squared (R2): $\approx 0.9999999988$
*   The scatter plot of actual vs. predicted prices showed a strong linear relationship, with points closely clustered around the ideal diagonal line, visually confirming the high accuracy.

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The trained `RandomForestRegressor` model was successfully saved to `flight_price_model.pkl` using the pickle library.
*   A Python script (`predict_price.py`) was created to load the model, preprocess new data (including date feature engineering and one-hot encoding), and make predictions.
*   A `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt` file were successfully created using `%%writefile` magic commands, defining the environment and dependencies for the model.
*   Attempts to build and run the Docker image failed because the execution environment did not have Docker installed or configured.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The model and inference script are ready for containerization, but a Docker-enabled environment is required to build and run the image.
*   The preprocessing logic in `predict_price.py` should be made more robust by saving and loading the fitted one-hot encoder and the list of training columns during the model training phase to ensure perfect column alignment during inference.

# ## Kubernetes and Model Deployment
# 
# Kubernetes significantly aids in scaling and managing model deployments.
# 
# ### Scaling:
# 
# Kubernetes facilitates scaling by allowing you to easily adjust the number of replicas of your application's pods. If the demand for predictions increases, you can simply increase the `replicas` count in your Deployment configuration. Kubernetes will then automatically create new pods to handle the increased load, distributing the incoming requests across the available instances. Conversely, you can decrease the replica count during periods of low demand to save resources.
# 
# ### Management:
# 
# Kubernetes provides robust features for managing deployments:
# 
# *   **Rolling Updates:** When you update your model or application code, Kubernetes performs rolling updates. This means it gradually replaces old pods with new ones, ensuring that your application remains available throughout the update process and allowing for easy rollbacks if issues arise.
# *   **Self-Healing:** Kubernetes monitors the health of your pods. If a pod crashes, becomes unresponsive, or fails its health checks, Kubernetes automatically restarts or replaces it, ensuring the desired number of healthy replicas is always maintained.
# 
# ### Potential Next Steps:
# 
# To further enhance the deployment, consider these next steps:
# 
# *   **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):** Implement an HPA to automatically scale the number of pods based on metrics like CPU utilization or custom metrics related to your application's load. This ensures that your deployment scales dynamically in response to real-time demand without manual intervention.
# *   **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:** Integrate your model training, packaging (Docker image creation), and deployment process into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This automates the entire workflow, enabling faster and more reliable updates to your deployed model.

"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   A Kubernetes Deployment object (`deployment.yaml`) was defined to specify the Docker image, replica count (set to 2), and desired state for the flight price predictor application.
*   A Kubernetes Service object (`service.yaml`) was defined to expose the deployed model, configured to forward traffic from port 80 to the container's port 5000 and set as a `LoadBalancer`.
*   Attempting to apply the Kubernetes configurations and verify the deployment using `kubectl` failed because the execution environment did not support running `kubectl` commands.
*   Consequently, testing the deployment by sending a request also failed due to the lack of a deployed service.

# 
# The workflow for the flight price prediction model can be represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), illustrating the dependencies and execution order of each stage. Using Apache Airflow as the orchestration tool, each stage will correspond to a task in the DAG.
# 
# Here is a conceptual representation of the DAG:
# mermaid
# graph TD
#     A[Data Ingestion] --> B(Feature Engineering);
#     B --> C(Data Preprocessing);
#     C --> D(Data Splitting);
#     D --> E(Model Selection);

#     K --> L;
#     L --> M(Deployment Verification);
#     M --> N(Deployment Testing);
#     N --> O(Discuss Scalability and Management);
# 
# **Explanation of Dependencies:**
# 
# 1.  **Data Ingestion** (A) is the initial stage and has no upstream dependencies. It must complete before any subsequent data processing can begin.
# 2.  **Feature Engineering** (B) depends on **Data Ingestion** (A) as it requires the raw data to create new features.
# 3.  **Data Preprocessing** (C) depends on **Feature Engineering** (B) as it processes the data with the newly engineered features.
# 4.  **Data Splitting** (D) depends on **Data Preprocessing** (C) as it splits the cleaned and processed data.
# 5.  **Model Selection** (E) can conceptually happen at any point after understanding the data (post-ingestion or preprocessing), but for a linear workflow representation, we place it after data splitting as the choice of model might be influenced by data characteristics.
# 6.  **Model Training** (F) depends on **Data Splitting** (D) and **Model Selection** (E). It needs the training data and the chosen model algorithm.
# 7.  **Model Evaluation** (G) depends on **Model Training** (F) and **Data Splitting** (D). It requires the trained model and the testing data to assess performance.
# 8.  **Model Saving** (H) depends on **Model Training** (F). The model can only be saved after it has been trained.
# 9.  **Model Inference Script Creation** (I) depends on **Model Saving** (H). The script needs to load the saved model.
# 10. **Environment Definition (Dockerfile)** (J) depends on **Model Inference Script Creation** (I) as the Dockerfile needs to copy the inference script.
# 11. **Dependency Management (requirements.txt)** (K) depends on **Model Inference Script Creation** (I) (and implicitly on Model Training/Evaluation as the script and model rely on these libraries). We place it here as the requirements are needed for the Docker environment.
# 12. **Applying Kubernetes Configurations** (L) depends on both **Environment Definition (Dockerfile)** (J) and **Dependency Management (requirements.txt)** (K) because the Kubernetes deployment uses the Docker image built based on these files.
# 13. **Deployment Verification** (M) depends on **Applying Kubernetes Configurations** (L) as you can only verify a deployment after it has been applied.
# 14. **Deployment Testing** (N) depends on **Deployment Verification** (M). Testing requires the deployment to be successfully verified and accessible.
# 15. **Discuss Scalability and Management** (O) depends on **Deployment Testing** (N). The discussion on scalability and management is relevant after the model has been successfully deployed and tested in the target environment.

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The MLflow library was successfully installed to facilitate model tracking and management.
*   An MLflow experiment named "Flight Price Prediction" was defined and used to group model training runs.
*   Hyperparameters (`random_state`) and evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R-squared) for the trained models were successfully logged within their respective MLflow runs.
*   The trained `RandomForestRegressor` models were logged as MLflow artifacts, although with warnings about deprecated arguments and missing signatures.
*   The process was successfully modified to run multiple experiments with different `random_state` values, with each run's parameters, metrics, and model being logged.
*   The trained model from a specific MLflow run (the latest in this case) was successfully loaded for inference.
*   Sample data was preprocessed to match the training data structure, and a price prediction was successfully made using the loaded model.

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %%markdown
# ## Chosen Classification Model: RandomForestClassifier
# 
# **Reasoning for Selection:**
# 
# `RandomForestClassifier` is chosen for this binary classification task (predicting gender) for several key reasons:
# 
# 1.  **Robustness:** It is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees, which generally leads to higher accuracy and better generalization compared to a single decision tree.
# 2.  **Handles Non-linearity:** Random Forests can capture complex, non-linear relationships between features (age and encoded company) and the target variable (gender).
# 3.  **Feature Importance:** It can provide insights into which features are most important for making predictions, which can be valuable for understanding the data.
# 4.  **Less Prone to Overfitting:** While individual decision trees can easily overfit, the ensemble nature of Random Forests with techniques like bagging helps reduce overfitting.
# 5.  **Handles Various Data Types:** It works well with both numerical ('age') and categorical (one-hot encoded 'company') features without requiring extensive scaling or normalization.

"""## Deploy the classification model

### Subtask:
Deploy the Docker image containing the classification model to a serving environment (e.g., Kubernetes, a cloud platform) to make it accessible for predictions.

## Test the deployed classification model

### Subtask:
Send a request to the deployed model to get a gender prediction and verify that it is working correctly.

## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The dataset contains 1340 entries with no missing values across columns 'code', 'company', 'name', 'gender', and 'age'.
*   The 'company' column was successfully one-hot encoded for model training.
*   The data was split into training (1072 samples) and testing (268 samples) sets.
*   A RandomForestClassifier model was trained on the data.
*   The trained model achieved an accuracy of approximately 29.5% on the test set.
*   The model's precision, recall, and F1-score were also around 29.5%.
*   The trained model was successfully saved to a file named `gender_classification_model.pkl`.
*   An inference script (`predict_gender.py`) was created to load the model, preprocess new data, and make predictions.
*   A Dockerfile and `requirements.txt` file were created to containerize the model and inference script.

# Task
Build a recommendation model to provide hotel suggestions based on user preferences and historical data using the "hotels.csv" and "users.csv" datasets.

"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %%markdown
# ## Chosen Recommendation Model Approach: Collaborative Filtering
# 
# **Reasoning for Selection:**
# 
# Collaborative filtering is chosen as the recommendation model approach for providing hotel suggestions based on user preferences and historical data. This approach is suitable because we have access to a user-item interaction matrix (`interaction_matrix`) which captures how users have interacted with hotels (in this case, the number of stays at each hotel).
# 
# Collaborative filtering works by:
# 
# 1.  **Identifying similar users:** Finding users who have similar historical preferences or behaviors (e.g., stayed at the same hotels).
# 2.  **Identifying similar items:** Finding items (hotels) that are liked by similar users or are similar based on user interactions.
# 
# Based on these similarities, the model can recommend hotels that a user hasn't stayed at yet but have been popular among users with similar tastes.
# 
# Given the structure of the `interaction_matrix` (users as rows, hotels as columns, and interaction strength as values), collaborative filtering methods, such as user-based or item-based collaborative filtering, or matrix factorization techniques (like Singular Value Decomposition - SVD), can be effectively applied to predict a user's potential interest in hotels they haven't visited. This aligns directly with the goal of providing hotel recommendations based on historical interaction data.
